In this website are available the codes used to reproduce the analysis and results of the paper describing the pliman R package

<img src = "figs/logo_pliman.jpg" width = 200px align = right>  `pliman` (**pl**ant **im**age **an**alysis) is designed to analyze plant images, especially related to leaf and grains.  The package will help you to:

* Measure leaf area;
* Measure disease severity;
* Count the number of lesions;
* Obtain the shape of lesions;
* Produce Standard Area Diagrams;
* Count objects in an image;
* Get object features (area, perimeter, radius, circularity, eccentricity, solidity);
* Get the RGB values for each object in an image;
* Get the object coordinates;
* Get the object contours;
* Get convex hulls;
* Isolate objects;
* Plot object measures.

`pliman` also provides useful functions for [operation](https://tiagoolivoto.github.io/pliman/reference/image_combine.html), [transformation](https://tiagoolivoto.github.io/pliman/reference/utils_transform.html), and [segmentation](https://tiagoolivoto.github.io/pliman/reference/image_binary.html) of images. Please, visit the [Examples](https://tiagoolivoto.github.io/pliman/index.html) page in `pliman` website for a detailed documentation of each function.
